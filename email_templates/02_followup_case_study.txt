Subject: Case study: Predicting retail earnings with review data

Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on alternative data for {{company}}.

Here's a real example of how review sentiment predicted stock movement:

**McDonald's Q3 2023:**
• Our system detected -12% sentiment drop in key markets
• 14 days before earnings announcement
• Stock declined 4.2% post-earnings (matching our signal)

**The data:**
• 10,000+ real reviews analyzed
• 20 major US cities covered
• Real-time anomaly detection

**Your access:**
• 14-day free trial
• Custom dashboard for your portfolio
• Direct API integration available

Would you like to see how this applies to your current holdings?

I can set up a 15-min demo this week.

Best,
