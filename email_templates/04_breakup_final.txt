Subject: Closing your file

{{first_name}},

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume alternative data signals aren't a priority for {{company}} right now.

I'll close your file, but wanted to leave you with one last data point:

**This week's signal:**
• Chipotle sentiment up 18% (10 major markets)
• Historical pattern: +3-5% stock movement within 30 days
• Last similar signal: January 2025 (+4.8% accuracy)

If you ever want to explore this, just reply to this email. I'll reopen your access.

Best of luck with your investments.

Best,

P.S. - If timing is just off right now, no problem. When would be better to reconnect? Q2? Q3?
