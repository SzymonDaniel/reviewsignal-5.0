Subject: Alternative data signal for {{company}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} tracks traditional metrics for investment decisions. What if you could predict {{chain}} performance before quarterly reports?

ReviewSignal analyzes 50,000+ consumer reviews daily to generate early warning signals:

• Sentiment trends (14-day advance indicators)
• Location-specific anomalies
• Foot traffic correlation proxies

Example: Our system flagged Starbucks NYC sentiment drop 2 weeks before their last earnings miss.

Quick question: Does your team currently use consumer sentiment data for investment signals?

Best,
ReviewSignal Team
