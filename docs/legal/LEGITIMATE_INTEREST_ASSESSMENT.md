**Data Processed:**

## 2. Purpose Test

*What is the legitimate interest being pursued?*

### 2.1 Our Legitimate Interest

ReviewSignal.ai has a legitimate interest in:

1. **Commercial growth:** Marketing our alternative data analytics platform to potential customers in the institutional investment sector.

2. **Market development:** Informing the hedge fund industry about a new category of alternative data (consumer sentiment from reviews) that can provide investment signals.

3. **Industry contribution:** Providing hedge funds with access to novel, differentiated data that can improve their investment decision-making process.

### 2.2 Why This Interest Is Legitimate

- **Standard industry practice:** B2B cold outreach is the established and expected method for alternative data vendors to reach institutional investors. Hedge fund professionals regularly receive and expect to be contacted about new data products.

- **Recognized by GDPR:** Recital 47 of the GDPR explicitly states: *"The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest."*

- **Professional context:** All contacts are professionals at their place of business, being contacted about products directly relevant to their professional responsibilities.

- **No consumer targeting:** We exclusively target business professionals in their professional capacity, not consumers in their personal lives.

### 2.3 Is the Purpose Specified?

Yes. The purpose is clearly defined: to inform hedge fund and investment professionals about ReviewSignal.ai's alternative data analytics platform through targeted B2B email outreach.

### 2.4 Is the Purpose Real and Not Speculative?

Yes. ReviewSignal.ai is an operational alternative data platform with:
- 44,500+ tracked locations
- 65,000+ consumer reviews analyzed
- Neural-powered anomaly detection (live)
- Functional API for data delivery
- Defined pricing tiers ($2,500 - $10,000+/month)

The outreach promotes a real, existing product to a clearly defined target audience.

## 3. Necessity Test

*Is the processing necessary for the legitimate interest?*

### 3.1 Is Direct Email Outreach Necessary?

**Yes.** Direct B2B email outreach is necessary because:

1. **Industry standard:** In the alternative data space, vendors reach hedge funds primarily through direct outreach, conferences, and referrals. Cold email is the most cost-effective initial touchpoint.

2. **No viable alternative for early-stage companies:** As a pre-revenue startup, we do not have the budget for conference sponsorships ($50,000+), advertising campaigns, or a dedicated sales force. Direct outreach is the proportionate approach for our stage.

3. **Targeted, not mass:** We do not send mass untargeted emails. Each campaign is segmented by title, seniority, and intent signals, ensuring relevance.

4. **Expected by recipients:** Hedge fund professionals regularly evaluate new data vendors. Our emails offer relevant information about a product that directly relates to their job function.

### 3.2 Could We Achieve the Same Goal With Less Data?

We have minimized the data we process:

- **Email address:** Essential for the communication itself.
- **Name:** Required for personalized, professional communication (non-personalized emails have very low engagement and are more likely to be perceived as spam).
- **Job title and company:** Necessary for segmentation to ensure relevance (a Portfolio Manager receives different messaging than a Quantitative Analyst).
- **LinkedIn URL:** Used for verification purposes only, not for automated scraping.

We do **not** collect or use: personal email addresses, home addresses, personal phone numbers, social media profiles (other than LinkedIn), or any sensitive personal data.

### 3.3 Is the Processing Proportionate?

**Yes.** The processing is proportionate because:

- We contact each individual a maximum of 3-4 times per sequence
- Each email includes a clear opt-out mechanism
- We honor opt-outs immediately and permanently
- We only use business contact information from legitimate B2B databases
- Emails are sent during business hours only (Mon-Fri, 09:00-18:00)
- Content is professional and relevant to the recipient's role

## 4. Balancing Test

*Do the individual's rights and freedoms override our legitimate interest?*

### 4.1 Impact on Individuals

**Nature of impact:**
- Receiving a small number (3-4) of professional B2B emails at their work email address
- Emails are about a product directly relevant to their job function
- Each email contains clear opt-out instructions
- No data is shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes

**Severity of impact:**
- **Minimal.** The impact is limited to receiving a few professional emails. No decisions are made about the individual based on this data. No profiling, scoring, or automated decision-making affects them.

**Likelihood of impact:**
- The individual will receive emails. This is certain.
- The likelihood of any negative impact beyond receiving unwanted emails is extremely low.

### 4.2 Reasonable Expectations of the Data Subject

Hedge fund and investment professionals can reasonably expect:

1. **To be contacted by data vendors:** The alternative data industry operates through direct outreach. Professionals in roles like "Head of Alternative Data" or "Portfolio Manager" are accustomed to receiving and evaluating vendor communications.

2. **Their business information to be available:** Business email addresses, titles, and company affiliations are publicly available on LinkedIn, company websites, and business databases. Professionals understand that this information may be used for B2B marketing.

3. **To receive relevant product information:** Our emails inform recipients about a product that directly relates to their professional decision-making process (alternative data for investment).

### 4.3 Relationship Between Controller and Data Subject

There is no pre-existing direct relationship. However:

- The relationship is B2B (business to business professional)
- The contact is within a well-defined industry context
- The content is specifically relevant to the recipient's professional role
- This is a standard pattern in the financial data industry

### 4.4 Safeguards We Implement

To mitigate any potential impact on data subjects, we implement:

1. **Easy opt-out:** Every email includes clear unsubscribe instructions (reply "UNSUBSCRIBE" or click unsubscribe link)
2. **Opt-out honored immediately:** Once opted out, the lead is flagged (`opted_out = true`) and excluded from all future campaigns
3. **Suppression list maintained:** Opted-out emails are kept on a suppression list to prevent re-contact
4. **Limited sequence length:** Maximum 3-4 emails per sequence, then automatic stop
5. **Business hours only:** Emails sent Monday-Friday, 09:00-18:00
6. **Segmented, relevant content:** Messages tailored to the recipient's specific role
7. **Transparency:** Physical address and company information included in every email
8. **GDPR rights honored:** Data access, erasure, rectification, and portability requests processed within 30 days
9. **Automated GDPR compliance:** Full GDPR API with automated data export, erasure, and consent management
10. **Data minimization:** Only business-relevant data collected, no personal/consumer data

### 4.5 Vulnerable Individuals

The data subjects are exclusively business professionals at institutional investment firms. None of the data subjects fall into categories of vulnerable individuals (children, elderly, patients, etc.).

### 4.6 Balancing Conclusion

**Our legitimate interest is NOT overridden by the rights and freedoms of the data subjects** because:

- The processing involves minimal, low-sensitivity business contact data
- The impact on individuals is limited to receiving a small number of relevant professional emails
- Recipients can reasonably expect this type of contact given their professional role
- Robust safeguards (easy opt-out, suppression lists, limited sequences, GDPR compliance) adequately protect individuals
- The processing does not involve profiling, automated decision-making, or any processing that could cause significant harm
- The data is used solely for direct B2B marketing communication, not for any other purpose
