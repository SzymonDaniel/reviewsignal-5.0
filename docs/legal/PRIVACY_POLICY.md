## 4. Lawful Basis for Processing

### 4.1 Legitimate Interest (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f))

For B2B cold outreach to hedge fund and investment professionals, we rely on **legitimate interest** as our lawful basis. Our Legitimate Interest Assessment is documented separately and considers:

- **Purpose:** Informing investment professionals about a relevant alternative data product
- **Necessity:** Direct B2B outreach is the standard and expected channel in the financial data industry
- **Balance:** We only contact professionals at their business email addresses, using publicly available business data, about a product directly relevant to their professional role. We provide clear opt-out mechanisms in every communication.

This is consistent with GDPR Recital 47, which recognizes that "the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest."

### 4.2 Performance of Contract (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b))

For customers who subscribe to our services, we process data as necessary to deliver the contracted services, manage accounts, and process payments.

### 4.3 Legal Obligation (GDPR Art. 6(1)(c))

We process certain data to comply with legal obligations, including responding to GDPR data subject requests, maintaining tax records, and complying with applicable financial regulations.

## 5. Data Retention

| Data Category | Retention Period | Rationale |

| B2B lead contact data | 24 months from collection, or until opt-out | Industry standard for B2B sales cycles |
| Opted-out leads | Email + opt-out date retained for 36 months (suppression list) | To prevent re-contacting opted-out individuals |
| Consumer review data | Indefinite (public data, anonymized analytics) | Core analytical dataset |
| Customer account data | Duration of contract + 24 months | Contract obligations and support |
| Payment records | 7 years | Tax and legal requirements |
| API usage logs | 12 months | Security and service monitoring |
| GDPR request records | 5 years | Regulatory compliance documentation |

After the retention period expires, data is either securely deleted or fully anonymized.
