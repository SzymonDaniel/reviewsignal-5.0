## ❓ FAQ SECTION (if template has)

### Q1: How is ReviewSignal different from traditional sentiment analysis?
**A:**
```
We use a quantum-inspired sentiment propagation algorithm
that detects "echo effects" - how sentiment at one location
impacts nearby locations and the entire chain. This gives
you early warnings before trends become obvious.
```

### Q2: What data sources do you use?
**A:**
```
Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Trustpilot, and more.
We aggregate data from 10+ sources and clean/validate
it using proprietary ML models.
```

### Q3: How accurate are the trading signals?
**A:**
```
Our BUY/HOLD/SELL signals have shown 68% accuracy over
36 months in backtesting. We track correlation between
sentiment changes and stock price movements within
30-90 day windows.
```

### Q4: Can I try before committing?
**A:**
```
Yes! We offer a 14-day free trial with 100 API calls.
No credit card required. Book a demo to see the platform
in action with your specific use cases.
```

### Q5: Do you support custom data sources?
**A:**
```
Yes, on Enterprise plans we can integrate custom data
sources including proprietary review platforms, social
media, and other alternative data feeds.
